# Python - import & modules

In this project, I learned about importing and using functions and creating modules in Python. I further practiced using the builtin function `dir()` and using command line arguments within Python programs.

i will solve the following task or problems:
task 0-->Write a program that imports the function def add(a, b): from the file add_0.py and prints the result of the addition 1 + 2 = 3
task 1-->Write a program that imports functions from the file calculator_1.py, does some Maths, and prints the result.
task -2-->Write a program that prints the number of and the list of its arguments.
task 3-->Write a program that prints the result of the addition of all arguments
