In this project, I continued to practice object-oriented programming in Python. I learned about class methods, static methods, class vs instance attributes, andbhow to use the special `__str__` and `__repr__` met

i will do the following task.
task 0 -->Write an empty class Rectangle that defines a rectangle:
task 1 -->Write a class Rectangle that defines a rectangle by: (based on 0-rectangle.py)
task 2 -->Write a class Rectangle that defines a rectangle by: (based on 1-rectangle.py)
task 3 -->Write a class Rectangle that defines a rectangle by: (based on 2-rectangle.py)
task 4 -->Write a class Rectangle that defines a rectangle by: (based on 3-rectangle.py)
task 5 -->Write a class Rectangle that defines a rectangle by: (based on 4-rectangle.py)
task 6 -->Write a class Rectangle that defines a rectangle by: (based on 5-rectangle.py)
task 7 -->Write a class Rectangle that defines a rectangle by: (based on 6-rectangle.py)
task 8 -->Write a class Rectangle that defines a rectangle by: (based on 7-rectangle.py)
task 9 -->Write a class Rectangle that defines a rectangle by: (based on 8-rectangle.py)
