# Python - Everything is object

In this project, I studied object instantiation in Python, delving into variable aliasing and object identifiers, types, and mutability. The project involved a series of quiz-like questions the answers to which I provided in single-line `.txt` files.

task -->0. Who am I?**
  * What function would you use to print the type of an object?

task -->1. Where are you?**
  * How do you get a variable's identifier (which is the memory address in the CPython implementation)?

task -->2. Right count**
  * In the following code, do `a` and `b` point to the same object?

task -->3. Right count =**
  *  In the following code, do `a` and `b` point to the same object?

task -->4. Right count =**
  * In the following code, do `a` and `b` point to the same object?
  
task -->5. Right count =+**
  * In the following code, do `a` and `b` point to the same object?

task -->6. Is equal**
  * What do these 3 lines print?

task -->7. Is the same**
  * What do these 3 lines print?

task -->8. Is really equal**
  *  What do these 3 lines print?

task -->9. Is really the same**
  *  What do these 3 lines print?

task -->10. And with a list, is it equal**
  *  What do these 3 lines print?
  
task -->11. And with a list, is it the same**
   What do these 3 lines print?

task -->12. And with a list, is it really equal**
  * What do these 3 lines print?

task -->13. And with a list, is it really the same**
  *  What do these 3 lines print?

task -->14. List append**
  * What does this script print?

task -->15. List add**
  *  What does this script print?

task -->16. Integer incrementation**
  * What does this script print?

task -->17. List incrementation**
  *  What does this script print?

task -->18. List assignation**
  * What does this script print?

task -->19. Copy a list object**
  *  Python function `def copy_list(l):` that returns a copy of a list.

task -->20. Tuple or not?**
  * Is `a` a tuple?

task -->21. Tuple or not?**
 *  Is `a` a tuple?

task -->22. Tuple or not?**
  *  Is `a` a tuple?

task -->23. Tuple or not?**
  *  Is `a` a tuple?

task -->24. Who I am?**
  * What does this script print?

task -->25. Tuple or not**
  *  What does this script print?

task -->26. Empty is not empty**
  *  What does this script print?

task -->27. Still the same**
  *  Will the last line of this script print `139926795932424`?

task -->28. Same or not?**
  * Will the last line of this script print `139926795932424`?

task -->29. #pythonic**
  *  Python function `magic_string()` that returns the string `"BestSchool"` n times the number of iteration.

task -->30. Low memory cost**
  *  Python class `LockedClass` with no attributes that prevents the user from dynamically creating any new instance attributes not called `first_name`.

task -->31. int 1/3**
  *  How many `int` objects are created by the execution of the first line in this script?
  * How many `int` objects are created by the execution of the second line in this script?
  
task -->32. int 2/3**
  * How many `int` objects are created by the execution of the first line in this script?
  *  How many `int` objects are created by the execution of the second line in this script?
  *  After the execution of line 3, is the `int` object pointed to by `a` deleted?
  * After the execution of line 4, is the `int` object pointed to by `b` deleted?
  *  How many `int` objects are created by the execution of the last line in this script?

task -->33. int 3/3**
  *  Before the execution of line 2 in this script, how many `int` objects have been created and are still in memory?
 
task -->34. Clear strings**
  * How many `str` objects are created by the execution of the first line in this script?
  * How many `str` objects are created by the execution of the second line in this script?
  * After the execution of line 3, is the `str` object pointed to by `a` deleted?
  * After the execution of line 4, is the `str` object pointed to by `b` deleted?
  * How many `str` objects are created by the execution of the last line in this script?
